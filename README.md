# JavaScript Exercises

## Chapter 1 – Cheat Sheet

Make a “cheat sheet” that summarizes the four data types and the JavaScript operators (arithmetic, concatenation, comparison, logic, unary, and ternary) covered in chapter 1\. For each of these, include _your own example._ Do not copy the examples from the textbook. A template is provided for you below.

## Chapter 2 – Hee Haw!

Hee Haw! Write a console program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 to the console. For any number evenly divisible by 3, print “Hee!” instead of the number. For any number evenly divisible by 5, print “Haw!” instead of the number. For any number evenly divisible by both 3 _and_ 5, print “Hee Haw!” instead of the number. Make sure that exclamation points are displayed as shown. Sample output on the right:

## Chapter 3 – Hee Haw Function

Write a function heeHaw() that takes any number as an input and prints the numbers from 1 to that number to the console, using the same rules as the Chapter 2 exercise. If the user passes in an invalid parameter, print an error message. Write multiple statements to test your function. Make sure that your test output is clear.

Challenge: Write a recursive version of your function.

## Chapter 4 – Array to Object

Read chapter 4 in Eloquent JavaScript. Then, create an array-object.html file that links to a JavaScript file called array-object.js. Submit a link to your html file in Canvas.

In your JavaScript file, define a function that accepts an array as a parameter, and returns an object. The function should convert the array into an object with properties containing the array values, grouped by type.

So, for example, given this array as input:

var input = [ -1, 5, "cat", false, 10.2, true, "dog" ];

The function would return the following object:

var result = {

strings: [ "cat", "dog" ],

numbers: [ -1, 5, 10.2 ],

booleans: [ false, true ]

};

Test your function. All output should be displayed inside an element on the web page. Console output will be ignored.

## Chapter 5

Read chapter 5 in Eloquent JavaScript. Then, create a json-search.html file that links to json-search.js. Next, create a json file that contains data for at least five people. Data fields should include, at a minimum: name, sex, born, died, father, and mother. Include entries for Jane Doe and Jane Ramirez.

Your html page should contain a header, a text input and a Search button. When the button is clicked, search the JSON file for a match. If a match is found, display the person’s information. If no match was found, display a message.

Your search should be case-insensitive, so “jane doe” and “Jane Doe” are equivalent searches. You should also account for partial searches, so “Jane” should display both “Jane Doe” and “Jane Ramirez.”

Submit a link to your html file in Canvas.

Challenge: Modify your JSON file so that name, father and mother consist of “first” and “last” fields.
